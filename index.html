        <div class="container-fluid">
          <p>As a person who has endured a lot of hardships in life and gets anxious rapidly I found that reading the Bible is a great coping skill to help alliviate stress. More than often, when we are faced with a storm we automatically try to have control over the situation and try to solve it but end up failing. That's when discouragement begins to enter our lives. We must turn to the one who is in control of all things. God holds our lives in his hands and is the only one who can resolve our battles, bring peace and calm our anxious minds.</p>
          <p>Here are some personal eye opening reflections and thoughts that can not only help us soothe our worry butmmay also help you gain some wisdom.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
              <div class="row">

                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <h1 style="color: #D4AF37">Don't waste your angel</h1>
                  <p>Sometimes God removes something from your life and you trip over it like if it was still there because you can't change your mind and be renewed according to your new reality.</p>
                  <p>When God sets perimeters for your life it is to give you permission to enjoy his promises within the perimeters of his principles so you are not destroyed by the very thing God intended to bless you with</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <h1 style="color: #D4AF37">Never ending potential in Christ!</h1>
                  <h2 style="color: white">"Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine according to his power that is at work within us." -Ephisians 3:20</h2>
                  <p>Forgetting what happened in the past or whatever may be troubling you at the moment, if we take this verse into mental acceptance I can assure that it will be the spark of your successful future in Christ. Let the truth sink into yourself so that you may allow God to manifest Himself in us. Any improvements or wise desires we are yearning for on the "outside" must first begin from within. The verse states that "His power is at work within us" so perhaps changing the way you think can change your future.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <h1 style="color: #D4AF37">"If you can believe, all things are possible to him that believes." -Mark 9:23</h1>
                  <p>This is Jesus' mindset but is it yours? We should take our eyes off form ourselves and start prioritizing on what God can do. "Be not afraid, only believe", your faith is a Godly tool that can secure you to God's power and ability. His ability is not dependant on us. We were and never will be perfect therefore, it is crucial to understand that God's potential is simply dependant on our faith in His ability not our goodness. Success in christ is waiting to be recieved by faith.</p>
